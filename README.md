## Ruby Line Project 

Welcome to the home of my final project at The Iron Yard! This app does the following things: 
* Gives a list of Metro stations and Bikeshare stations within 5 miles of your current location
* Based on the Metro station, gives you a list of the trains leaving within 10 minutes 
* Gives you a fare estimate comparison between Uber and WMATA for you and a group of people (2 or more) to travel from point A to point B 
* Allows you to input point A and point B to generate aforementioned results 

My portion of the project includes :
* Making 'GET' requests to retrieve UBER, WMATA, Bikeshare data from my Ruby partner 
* Utilizing the Google Maps API to generate and style the map, add geocoding features and placing markers based on location input. 
*UI design 


Notes: 

The application will be running on http://localhost:3000 and serving static assets out of /public. 
My partner's servers have not been deployed to heroku yet, so the data (for right now) will not be shown if you run the app.
